# Complie-and-run
A basic bash script which automates the task of writing 'g++ <filename>' and then './a.out' for compiling a C++ program.
Usage:
  Type 'cnr' without a file name then it will find the most recently modified file and compiles and runs it.
  Type 'cnr <filename>' to compile and run a particular file.
  
Note:
  Copy this script into any of the paths in $PATH, so that bash automatically finds the script.
